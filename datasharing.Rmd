# What is Open and Reproducible?

## FAIR

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reproducible

Wilkinson, M. D. et al. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. Sci. Data 3:160018 doi: [10.1038/sdata.2016.18](http://dx.doi.org/0.1038/sdata.2016.18) (2016).

# Why Open and Reproducible?

## Why Open and Reproducible
- Easily allow other to build upon your work
- Increase transfer of knowledge
- Improve transparency, discourage fraudulent work
- The funding agency [tells you to](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_policies.html)
- Find collaborators 
- Get credit for it ([you](http://f1000research.com/articles?tab=ALL&articleTypes=DATA_NOTE) [can](http://www.nature.com/sdata) [publish](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/) [about it](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/data/about))

## Why (not) Open and Reproducible
- Risky for early-career researchers ([counterpoint](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-open-and-tenured.html))
- Publisher limitations
- [#researchparasites](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23researchparasites&src=typd) (NEJM 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMe1516564)
- I don't get credit
- Getting 'scooped'

## Why (not) Open and Reproducible { .flexbox .vcenter}

If you work openly, 'getting scooped' is plagarism.

# How Open and Reproducible?

## Getting started { .smaller }

Organizing analyses so that they are reproducible is not easy. It requires diligence and a considerable investment of time: to learn new computational tools, and to organize and document analyses as you go.

But **partially reproducible** is better than **not at all reproducible**. Just try to make your next paper or project better organized than the last.

There are many paths toward reproducible research, and you shouldnâ€™t try to change all aspects of your current practices all at once. Identify one weakness, adopt an improved approach, refine that a bit, and then move on to the next thing.

## Getting started

1. Plan before you start
1. Organize and keep track of things
1. Archive and share
