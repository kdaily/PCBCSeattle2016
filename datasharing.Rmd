# Quiz!

## Open Science

How many people practice open science?

# What is Open Data/Science?

## FAIR

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reproducible

Both for Humans and our Computer Overlords.

# Why Open and Reproducible?

## Why Open and Reproducible
- Easily allow other to build upon your work
- Increase transfer of knowledge
- Improve transparency, discourage fraudulent work
- The funding agency [tells you to](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_policies.html)
- Find collaborators 
- Get credit for it ([you](http://f1000research.com/articles?tab=ALL&articleTypes=DATA_NOTE) [can](http://www.nature.com/sdata) [publish](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/) [it](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/data/about))

## Why (not) Open and Reproducible
- Risky for early-career researchers ([counterpoint](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-open-and-tenured.html))
- Publisher limitations
- [#researchparasites](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23researchparasites&src=typd) (NEJM 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMe1516564)
- I don't get credit
- Getting 'scooped' (that's plagarism! Use a [license](www.choosealicense.com))

# How Open and Reproducible?

## Getting started {.build}

Organizing analyses so that they are reproducible is not easy. It requires diligence and a considerable investment of time: to learn new computational tools, and to organize and document analyses as you go.

But **partially reproducible** is better than **not at all reproducible**. Just try to make your next paper or project better organized than the last.

1. Plan before you start
1. Organize and keep track of things
1. Archive and share

# Data Sharing Best Practices

## Data sharing | [click me!](http://kdaily.github.io/datasharing/pres.html)

Let's say you have some data (not necessarily big data) that you want to share.

These best practices work if whether you are sharing with a computational colleague or with a larger community.
