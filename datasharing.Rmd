# What is Open and Reproducible?

## FAIR

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reproducible

Wilkinson, M. D. et al. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. Sci. Data 3:160018 doi: [10.1038/sdata.2016.18](http://dx.doi.org/0.1038/sdata.2016.18) (2016).

# Why Open and Reproducible?

## Why Open and Reproducible
- Easily allow other to build upon your work
- Increase transfer of knowledge
- Improve transparency, discourage fraudulent work
- The funding agency [tells you to](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_policies.html)
- Find collaborators 
- Get credit for it ([you](http://f1000research.com/articles?tab=ALL&articleTypes=DATA_NOTE) [can](http://www.nature.com/sdata) [publish](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/) [about it](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/data/about))

## Why (not) Open and Reproducible
- Risky for early-career researchers ([counterpoint](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-open-and-tenured.html))
- Publisher limitations
- [#researchparasites](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23researchparasites&src=typd) (NEJM 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMe1516564)
- I don't get credit
- Getting 'scooped' (that's plagarism! Use a [license](www.choosealicense.com))

# How Open and Reproducible?

## Getting started { .smaller }

Organizing analyses so that they are reproducible is not easy. It requires diligence and a considerable investment of time: to learn new computational tools, and to organize and document analyses as you go.

But **partially reproducible** is better than **not at all reproducible**. Just try to make your next paper or project better organized than the last.

## Getting started

1. Plan before you start
1. Organize and keep track of things
1. Archive and share

# Data Sharing Best Practices

## Be consistent.

- Categorical variables (`M`, `male`, `Male`)
- Fixed code for missing values (`NA` = Not Applicable or Not Available?)
- Covariate/variable naming (the column names)
- Subject IDs (`1`, `cell1`, `Cell1`, `The first cell`)
- Data layout
- File names
- Dates
- Note-taking

## Save data in text files (csv)

- xls is proprietary
- Text works in many programs (including Excel)

## Dates. | ([xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/1179/))

## Dates.

In Excel, use plain text column for dates, or proceed with caution.

(e.g., everyone's favorite gene, "10/04/2015"")

## No empty cells.

Fill them in.

Debatable...

https://kdaily.github.io/dataorg/pages/no_empty_cells.html

## Make it a rectangle.

Spreadsheets are inherently rectangular.

Maybe, you need multiple rectangles of data (don't duplicate info across)

If you can't do it with one or more rectangles, spreadsheets are not the answer.

https://kdaily.github.io/dataorg/pages/rectangle.html

## Create a data dictionary.
* The exact variable (column) name as in the data file
* A version of that name that might be used for plotting, summarizing
* A longer explanation of what the variable represents.
* The measurement units.
* Expected values (range of min and max, which text, etc.)

This is meta*data*, so what shape should it be in?

## No cell formatting.

No font color or highlighting as data (turn it into a column).

It's OK ONLY IF it's not in raw data!

## Sharing and archiving | [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/)

We are:

1. **F**indable
1. **A**ccessible
1. **I**nteroperable
1. **R**eusable
